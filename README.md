This repository demonstrates a common but subtle issue with Firebase Authentication's `onAuthStateChanged` listener.  The listener may not reliably update the UI when a user's session expires, especially in environments with intermittent network connectivity.  The provided code showcases the problematic behavior and a solution to improve its reliability.  See the `authBug.js` for the error and `authSolution.js` for a robust solution.
